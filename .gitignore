# native/include/ and native/prebuilds/ are intentionally tracked:
# - native/include/ contains the upstream uplink-c headers needed to compile
#   the addon. They are patched for MSVC compat and committed so that npm
#   install (hybrid path) can run node-gyp without a separate header download.
# - native/prebuilds/ contains platform-specific binaries built by CI and
#   committed for the "prebuilt-shipped" fast-install path.
